## recursion
A recusion exercise for The Odin Project course.

# fibs.js
The `fibs(n)` function takes a number and returns an array with the corresponding numbers in the fibonacci sequence. This function uses iteration to achieve this result.

# fibsRec.js
The `fibsRec(n)` does the same but uses recursion to achieve the same result.

# mergeSort.js
The `mergeSort(arr)` function takes an array of unsorted numbers. It uses recursion to merge sort the numbers into a new array.

# How to use
Make sure nodejs installed. In the directory run the command `node fibs.js`, `node fibsRec.js` or `node mergeSort.js`, and in the output you should see the test cases and results.
